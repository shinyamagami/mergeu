This repository is a place for learning the flow of sending a pull request and getting merged.
I was super nervous just before sending my first pull request in public because I did not know
how to do it.

This is a place where you send a pull request without getting nervous. 
Just a place for learning. Any pull requests will be merged except a few.

This repository will approve your pull requests and merge it under these condition.
1. No conflict.

The flow is
1. Send a pull request
2. Get approved or denied
3. Get merged.
4. Get confident.
